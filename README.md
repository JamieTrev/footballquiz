## Testing
### Overview

In the development of our project, we have thoroughly tested each feature to ensure that the site functions as intended and provides an optimal user experience. Our testing approach covered various aspects, including feature testing, cross-browser compatibility, and responsiveness on different screen sizes.

### Feature Testing

We conducted comprehensive feature testing to verify the functionality of each component of our project. Here are some key features we tested and confirmed to be working seamlessly:
    
-   **Navigation:** The navigation menu and links were tested to confirm that users can easily move between different sections of the site without encountering broken links or unexpected behaviour.
-  **Multiple-Choice Button:** We tested the multiple-choice buttons. For every question presented to the user, we confirmed the following:
	-	Each answer choice accurately represents the options provided.
	-	Users can select a single answer choice for each question.
	-	Users cannot select more than one answer choice simultaneously.
	-	The selected answer is visually highlighted for clarity and once clicked the users cannot change their answer for that specific question.
	
- **Score Tracking Validation:** We have thoroughly validated the score tracking mechanism within our application. Our testing included:
	- Answering questions correctly and ensuring that the score increments accurately.
	- Answering questions incorrectly and confirming that the score remains unchanged or decrements as expected.
	- Navigating through different sections of the application and verifying that the score remains consistent.    

### Cross-Browser Compatibility

We took extra care to ensure our project works consistently across different web browsers. Our testing included the following browsers:

-   Google Chrome
-   Mozilla Firefox
-   Microsoft Edge
-   Safari

## Validator Testing
- HTML
	- No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator
- CSS
	- No errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator
- Java Script
	- No errors were found when passing through a linter (JSHint)

## Unfixed Bugs
